    "# **I. Model Selection & Baseline Leaderboard**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **I.1. Objective & Experiment Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this phase is to establish a **performance baseline** using default algorithms. This \"Leaderboard\" serves two critical functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Complexity Justification:** It determines whether complex non-linear models (like XGBoost) provide a statistically significant advantage over simpler linear models (Logistic Regression).\n",
    "2.  **Overfitting Detection:** By simultaneously measuring performance on the **Training Set** and the **Validation Set**, we identify models that \"memorize\" the data rather than generalizing the underlying cluster logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Candidate Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Logistic Regression:** A linear baseline. If this performs well, the cluster boundaries are simple and linear.\n",
    "*   **Random Forest:** A bagging ensemble. It captures non-linear interactions and serves as the direct comparator to Group 1's approach.\n",
    "*   **XGBoost / LightGBM:** Gradient boosting machines. These are the current industry standard for tabular data, expected to handle the \"Augmented Features\" (like delivery delays) most effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **I.2. Environment Setup & Metric Definition**\n",
    "To ensure rigorous evaluation, we define a standardized **Evaluation Function** that will be applied identically to all models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Metrics Selection:**\n",
    "*   **F1-Score (Weighted):** The primary success metric. It accounts for the **Class Imbalance** (Cluster 2 is only 3%) by weighting the score of each class by its support (number of true instances).\n",
    "*   **Log Loss (Cross-Entropy):** Measures the **confidence** of predictions. A model that predicts the correct class with 51% probability is \"worse\" than one predicting with 90% probability, even if accuracy is identical.\n",
    "*   **ROC-AUC (One-vs-Rest):** Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes across different probability thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Implementation: Setup & Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Import necessary libraries, load the stratified datasets created in ***Data Engineering*** section, and define a reusable function to calculate and display the required metrics."

    "*   **CatBoost** achieved the highest **Macro F1 (0.9985)**, indicating it handles the minority \"VIP\" cluster slightly better than its competitors.\n",
    "\n",

    "**B. Validation of the Surrogate Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "The exceptionally high scores across all models (even Logistic Regression at 96.5%) confirm a critical theoretical point: **The K-Means clusters are deterministic and well-separated.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Since the Target Variable ($Y$) was generated using the Input Features ($X$), there is a direct mathematical relationship between them.\n",
    "\n",

    "The **Overfitting Gap** (Train Score minus Validation Score) is negligible across the board (~0.001 to 0.005).

    "\n",
    "To extract the maximum performance from our top 3 candidates (**CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost**), we abandon brute-force methods (Grid Search) in favor of **Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)**, implemented via the **Optuna** framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **II.1.1. Methodology Selection**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Why not Grid Search?** Grid search suffers from the \"Curse of Dimensionality.\" Tuning 6 parameters with 5 options each results in $5^6 = 15,625$ trials per model. This is computationally infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Why not Hyperband?** Hyperband relies on aggressive early stopping (killing trials that perform poorly in early iterations). For Gradient Boosting, this is risky; models with low learning rates often start slow but achieve the best final convergence. Killing them early leads to sub-optimal results.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Why Bayesian Optimization (TPE)?** TPE is an \"informed\" search methods. It builds a probabilistic model ($P(Score | Hyperparameters)$) based on past trials to predict which hyperparameters are likely to yield better results. It balances **Exploration** (trying new values) and **Exploitation** (refining the best values).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **II.1.2. The \"Beat the Default\" Heuristic**\n",
    "\n",
    "A common pitfall in tuning is producing a model *worse* than the default settings (Negative Lift). This happens when the search space is too restrictive or the optimizer gets stuck in a local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The Solution:** We utilize Optuna's `enqueue_trial` feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Mechanism:** We explicitly force the optimizer to evaluate the **Default Hyperparameters** as Trial 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Guarantee:** This ensures the final \"Best Params\" are mathematically guaranteed to be **$\\ge$ Default Performance**.\n",

    "*   **Metric:** **Log Loss (Cross-Entropy)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Reasoning:** F1-Score is a \"step function\" (predictions are either 0 or 1). Log Loss is continuous and smooth, providing the optimizer with better gradients to find the global minimum. A model with lower Log Loss is more confident and robust.\n"
