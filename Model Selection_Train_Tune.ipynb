    "# **I. Model Selection & Baseline Leaderboard**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **I.1. Objective & Experiment Design**\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this phase is to establish a **performance baseline** using default algorithms. This \"Leaderboard\" serves two critical functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Complexity Justification:** It determines whether complex non-linear models (like XGBoost) provide a statistically significant advantage over simpler linear models (Logistic Regression).\n",
    "2.  **Overfitting Detection:** By simultaneously measuring performance on the **Training Set** and the **Validation Set**, we identify models that \"memorize\" the data rather than generalizing the underlying cluster logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Candidate Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Logistic Regression:** A linear baseline. If this performs well, the cluster boundaries are simple and linear.\n",
    "*   **Random Forest:** A bagging ensemble. It captures non-linear interactions and serves as the direct comparator to Group 1's approach.\n",
    "*   **XGBoost / LightGBM:** Gradient boosting machines. These are the current industry standard for tabular data, expected to handle the \"Augmented Features\" (like delivery delays) most effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **I.2. Environment Setup & Metric Definition**\n",
    "To ensure rigorous evaluation, we define a standardized **Evaluation Function** that will be applied identically to all models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Metrics Selection:**\n",
    "*   **F1-Score (Weighted):** The primary success metric. It accounts for the **Class Imbalance** (Cluster 2 is only 3%) by weighting the score of each class by its support (number of true instances).\n",
    "*   **Log Loss (Cross-Entropy):** Measures the **confidence** of predictions. A model that predicts the correct class with 51% probability is \"worse\" than one predicting with 90% probability, even if accuracy is identical.\n",
    "*   **ROC-AUC (One-vs-Rest):** Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes across different probability thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Implementation: Setup & Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** Import necessary libraries, load the stratified datasets created in ***Data Engineering*** section, and define a reusable function to calculate and display the required metrics."

    "\n",
    "We successfully evaluated four distinct algorithms on the stratified datasets. The goal was to select a single \"Champion\" model for hyperparameter tuning based on **Generalization** (Validation F1) and **Confidence** (Log Loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Leaderboard:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Rank | Model | Val F1-Score | Val Log-Loss | Interpretation |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **1** | **LightGBM** | **0.9967** | 0.0097 | **The Winner.** Highest accuracy and extremely fast convergence. |\n",
    "| **2** | **XGBoost** | 0.9964 | **0.0092** | Very close second. Slightly better calibrated probabilities (lower Log Loss) but marginally lower F1. |\n",
    "| **3** | **Random Forest** | 0.9951 | 0.0229 | Excellent accuracy, but significantly worse Log Loss (0.02 vs 0.009), indicating it is \"less sure\" of its predictions than boosting models. |\n",
    "| **4** | **Logistic Regression** | 0.9506 | 0.1184 | The linear baseline performed surprisingly well (95%), proving the clusters have strong linear separability, but it cannot capture the edge cases like the tree models. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "1.  **The \"Surrogate\" Validation:** All tree-based models achieved >99.5% accuracy. This effectively proves that **Group 1's clusters are deterministic.** The clusters are not random noise; they follow a strict logic based on the input features, which the models successfully reverse-engineered.\n",
    "2.  **Boosting > Bagging:** Both Gradient Boosting methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) outperformed Random Forest in **Log Loss** by a factor of 2. They are not just guessing the right class; they are assigning it with near-100% probability.\n",
    "3.  **Selection Decision:** We select **XGBoost** for the Tuning Phase.\n",
    "    *   *Why not LightGBM?* Although LightGBM won on F1 by a tiny margin (0.0003), XGBoost has the **lowest Log Loss (0.0092)** and creates the most robust **SHAP plots**, which is our ultimate goal. (XGBoost's `TreeExplainer` is the gold standard for interpretability).\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Rightarrow$ **Next Step:** We proceed to **Phase B: Hyperparameter Tuning of XGBoost** to prevent overfitting and ensure the model remains stable when we strip away features later."

    "### **II.3. Conclusion: Hyperparameter Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "We moved beyond the default settings to rigorously optimize the XGBoost architecture using **Bayesian Optimization (Optuna)**. By expanding the search space and reducing constraints, we allowed the model to find a more complex and precise configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization Results:**\n",
    "*   **The Winning Configuration:** The algorithm converged on a \"Deep & Slow\" learning strategy:\n",
    "    *   **`max_depth: 12`**: Significantly deeper than the default (6), allowing the model to capture highly complex, non-linear interaction effects between features.\n",
    "    *   **`learning_rate: 0.033`**: A low learning rate (vs default 0.3) combined with high **`n_estimators: 1321`** ensures precise convergence without overshooting the minima.\n",
    "    *   **`gamma` & `reg_alpha` $\\approx$ 0**: The optimizer determined that strict regularization was unnecessary; the signal in the data is strong and clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Impact:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Default Model | Tuned Model | Improvement |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Log Loss (Confidence)** | 0.00920 | **0.00863** | **+6.17% Lift** |\n",
    "| **F1-Score (Accuracy)** | 0.9964 | **0.9971** | **+0.07% Lift** |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "*   **Precision Engineering:** The positive lift of **6.17%** in Log Loss proves that the default model was slightly \"under-fitted\" to the nuances of the clusters. The tuned model is statistically more confident in its predictions.\n",
    "*   **Surrogate Validity:** With an F1-Score of **99.71%**, the model effectively becomes a \"Digital Twin\" of the clustering logic. We can now be certain that explaining this model is equivalent to explaining the clusters themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Rightarrow$ **Verdict:** We deploy the **Tuned XGBoost (v2)** as the finalized engine for the Feature Importance & SHAP analysis."
