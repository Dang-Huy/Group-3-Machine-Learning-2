    "### **I.1.1. Problem Statement: The \"Black Box\" Dilemma**\n",
    "\n",
    "Group 1 successfully segmented customers into **4 distinct clusters** using K-Means. However, K-Means is a distance-based algorithm that does not inherently explain *why* a customer belongs to a specific group. To derive actionable business insights, we must bridge the gap between **mathematical proximity** and **behavioral interpretability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We treat this as a **Supervised Surrogate Learning** task. By training a robust classifier (Random Forest/XGBoost) to predict the K-Means cluster labels ($Y$) using customer features ($X$), we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Validate Cluster Stability:** If a supervised model cannot predict the clusters, the clusters are likely random noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Extract Feature Importance:** Identify which behaviors (e.g., *Credit Card usage* vs. *Shipping delays*) are the dominant drivers of segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **I.1.2. Data Engineering Strategy**\n",
    "To ensure the surrogate model captures the full picture, we construct a **Composite Feature Matrix ($X$)** consisting of two tiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Tier 1: The Baseline (Reconstruction)**\n",
    "    *   **Source:** `processed_customer_data.csv`\n",
    "    *   **Logic:** We strictly retain the **7 original features** used by Group 1 (Recency, Frequency, Monetary, Review Score, Installments, Freight, Items).\n",
    "    *   **Why:** These features mathematically defined the clusters. Excluding them would break the logical link between Input and Target, rendering methods like SHAP invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Tier 2: The Augmented Features (Hypothesis Testing)**\n",
    "    *   **Source:** Raw Olist Datasets (`olist_orders`, `olist_payments`, `olist_customers`).\n",
    "    *   **Logic:** We engineer new features to test specific business hypotheses:\n",
    "        *   **Financial Behavior:** `credit_card_usage_ratio`. (Hypothesis: High-value \"Champions\" prefer credit leverage).\n",
    "        *   **Logistics Experience:** `avg_delivery_days`. (Hypothesis: Long wait times drive customers into the \"Unhappy\" cluster).\n",
    "        *   **Geographic Context:** `state_freq_encoding`. (Hypothesis: Remote states pay higher freight, impacting their cluster assignment).\n",
    "\n",
    "=> **The Stratification Mandate & Leakage Prevention**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The Risk of Representation Bias:** K-Means minimizes mathematical inertia, which often results in naturally unequal cluster sizes. A standard random split poses a severe risk of **under-sampling minority clusters** in the Test set. If a cluster represents a small fraction of the population, a random split could result in a Test set with zero examples of that behavior, rendering evaluation impossible.\n",
    "*   **Preventing Distributional Leakage:** To ensure the Supervised Model is evaluated on a truly representative sample, we must enforce **Stratified Sampling**. This technique locks the ratio of the Target Variable ($Y$) across Train, Validation, and Test sets.\n",
    "    *   *Mathematical Guarantee:* If Cluster $k$ constitutes $p\\%$ of the total dataset, it must constitute exactly $p\\%$ of the Training set and $p\\%$ of the Test set.\n",
    "*   **Strict Separation:** The splitting process must occur **after** dataset assembly but **strictly before** any model training or hyperparameter tuning. This isolation prevents the model from \"peeking\" at the Test distribution during the optimization phase, ensuring the reported metrics reflect true generalization capability.\n"

    "Let $S$ be the full dataset. We partition $S$ into three subsets $\\{S_{train}, S_{val}, S_{test}\\}$ such that:\n",
    "$$ S_{train} \\cup S_{val} \\cup S_{test} = S $$\n",
    "$$ S_{train} \\cap S_{val} = \\emptyset, \\quad S_{train} \\cap S_{test} = \\emptyset, \\quad S_{val} \\cap S_{test} = \\emptyset $$\n",
    "$\\Rightarrow$ **Guarantee:** No data point appears in more than one set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **II.2. Stratification Logic**\n",
    "Given the **Class Imbalance** identified in Section I (Cluster 2 represents only ~3% of the population), a random split is statistically invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The Risk:** In a random 15% split, there is a non-zero probability that **Cluster 2** will be severely under-represented or absent in the Test set.\n",
    "*   **The Solution:** We enforce **Stratified Sampling** on the target variable (`cluster_id`).\n",
    "    *   **Mechanism:** The algorithm forces the distribution of the target variable in all three sets to match the original dataset.\n",
    "    *   **Implication:** If Cluster 2 is **3%** of the original data, it will be exactly **3%** of the Training data, **3%** of the Validation data, and **3%** of the Test data. $\\Rightarrow$ **Ensures Evaluation Stability.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **II.3. Feature Isolation**\n",
    "To prevent **Data Leakage**, we strictly define the feature matrix ($X$) before splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Excluded Variables (Potential Leaks/Noise):**\n",
    "    *   `customer_unique_id`: High-cardinality identifier with no predictive value.\n",
    "    *   `state`: Raw categorical string (replaced by encoding).\n",
    "    *   `cluster_id`: The Target ($Y$).\n",
    "*   **Included Variables (The Feature Matrix $X$):** 7 Baseline Features + 3 Augmented Features\n",
    "    1.  `recency_days`\n",
    "    2.  `frequency`\n",
    "    3.  `monetary`\n",
    "    4.  `avg_review_score`\n",

    "    6.  `avg_freight`\n",
    "    7.  `avg_items_per_order`\n",
    "    8.  `state_freq_encoding` (Geographic)\n",
    "    9.  `credit_card_usage_ratio` (Financial)\n",
    "    10. `avg_delivery_days` (Logistics)\n",
    "\n",
    "## **II.4. Implementation Part 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Physically divide the `engineered_data_full.csv` into 6 files (`X_train`, `y_train`, `X_val`, `y_val`, `X_test`, `y_test`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on Saving:** Saving these splits is **mandatory**. It ensures that when we perform Hyperparameter Tuning later (which may require restarting the kernel), the \"Validation Set\" remains static and reproducible."

    "## **III.1. Target Distribution: The Class Imbalance Challenge**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset exhibits **severe class imbalance**, characterizing the customer base into distinct tiers of population density:\n",
    "*   **Cluster 0 & 1 (The Majority):** Together, they constitute **~87.6%** of the total population ($45.7k + 36.0k$). These likely represent the \"Standard\" or \"Occasional\" shoppers.\n",
    "*   **Cluster 3:** A moderate segment (~$8.7k$, **~9.4%**).\n",
    "*   **Cluster 2 (The Critical Minority):** Represents only **~2.8k users (3.0%)**. Based on Group 1's findings, this is the **High-Value/Loyal** segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic Implication:**\n",
    "*   **The \"Accuracy Trap\":** A naive model could achieve **97% accuracy** simply by predicting \"Not Cluster 2\" for every customer. This would result in a useless model that fails to identify the most valuable clients.\n",
    "*   **Validation of Stratification:** This distribution proves that **Random Splitting is statistically dangerous**. A random 15% test set runs a high risk of excluding Cluster 2 entirely. We successfully mitigated this via **Stratified Sampling**, locking these exact ratios across Train, Validation, and Test sets.\n",
    "*   **Metric Selection:** We **cannot use simple Accuracy**. Future evaluation must rely on **F1-Weighted** (to account for population size) or **Macro-Average F1** (to treat the minority Cluster 2 as equally important to the majority).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **III.2. Augmented Feature Correlation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyzed the relationship between our **Engineered Features** (Tier 2) and the **Cluster ID** to validate their potential predictive power.\n",
    "*   **Financial Signal:** `avg_installments` shows a meaningful positive correlation (**0.37**) with `cluster_id`. This aligns with the hypothesis that certain clusters (likely High Value) utilize different payment structures (credit leverage).\n",
    "*   **Credit Card Link:** `credit_card_usage_ratio` correlates strongly with `avg_installments` (**0.40**). This suggests that **Payment Method** is a proxy for **Purchasing Power**, confirming it as a valid feature for the supervised model.\n",
    "*   **Logistics & Geography:** `avg_delivery_days` has a strong negative correlation with `state_freq_encoding` (**-0.36**).\n",
    "    *   *Interpretation:* Lower frequency states (Remote areas like Amazonia) experience significantly higher delivery times.\n",
    "    *   *Cluster Impact:* While the direct correlation to `cluster_id` is low (**0.04**), this feature likely acts as a **non-linear interaction term** (e.g., High Delivery Time + High Freight $\\rightarrow$ Churn Cluster), which tree-based models (XGBoost) will capture better than this linear correlation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic Implication:**\n",
    "The augmented features are **not random noise**. They contain structural signals linking **Geography $\\rightarrow$ Logistics** and **Payment Type $\\rightarrow$ Financial Behavior**. Including them provides the Supervised Model with context that raw RFM metrics lack.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **III.3. Cluster Geography: 100% Stacked View**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization tests the hypothesis: *\"Do high-value customers only live in major cities?\"*\n",
    "*   **Universal Presence:** The distinct color bands (representing clusters) are present across **all 27 states**. This indicates that customer segmentation is primarily driven by **behavior**, not just location. High-value customers (Cluster 2 - Green) exist even in remote states (e.g., AC, RO).\n",
    "*   **Regional Variance:** While stable, the ratios shift in smaller states.\n",
    "    *   **Major Hubs (SP, RJ, MG):** Show a consistent, balanced distribution dominated by Cluster 0 (Blue) and 1 (Orange).\n",
    "    *   **Remote States (RR, AP, AC):** Show visible volatility in the ratios. For example, **RR (Roraima)** has a noticeably different composition of Cluster 0 vs. Cluster 1 compared to the national average.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic Implication:**\n",
    "*   **Geography as a Contextual Feature:** State alone is not a deterministic predictor (you can't predict a cluster solely by knowing the customer lives in Sao Paulo).\n",
    "*   **Nuance Value:** However, the variations in remote states confirm that **Frequency Encoding** the state was the correct approach. It allows the model to differentiate between \"Logistically Easy\" vs. \"Logistically Hard\" regions without exploding the feature space with 27 One-Hot columns."
